# resume

Org governance is canonical in `human-execution-engine`'s
`prompts/PROMPTING_RULES.md`. It is delivered to every session by the
`SessionStart` hook installed from the `dotfiles` repo:

    make claude-hooks

It is deliberately **not** `@import`-ed here. Measured 2026-08-31, with
sentinel strings probed from real sessions:

| mechanism | resolves? |
|---|---|
| `@import` whose path is inside this repo | yes |
| `@import` whose path resolves outside this repo | **no** |
| `.claude/rules/` symlink pointing outside this repo | **no** |
| `@https://` or `@http://` URL | **no** |
| `SessionStart` hook | yes |

All three failures are **silent** -- they look like they worked. So an
import line here would be decoration, not delivery.

The hook also carries no assumption about where your checkouts live. It
honours `HEE_REPO_DIR`, so an operator using `~/projects/` or anything
else works without editing a repo.

If the org rules are not in `/context`, the hook is not installed.

<!-- Repo-specific guidance belongs below this line, never above it. -->
